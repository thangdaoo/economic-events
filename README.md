# Trading Scripts
Here are a couple of Python scripts I created to assist me in my day trading journey. Each of the bullet points gives a brief explanation of what each script returns.

1. CompanyInfo
  - company bio
  - detailed market information of the company
2. EconomicCalendar
  - major economic events of the current trading week
3. TradingDaysCalendar
  - number of trading days & holidays in the current month
  - previous market closure
  - next market closure
4. UpcomingEarnings
  - list of upcoming earnings
