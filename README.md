# Trading Scripts

During my venture to become a consistently profitable day trader, I created a couple of Python scripts to assist me in this journey.

## Requirements

- Python3
- pip3
  
This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `re`
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup`
- `urlopen`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `date`

## Installation

- clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/thangdaoo/trading-scripts.git`

- install all the packages listed above

`pip3 install 'package-name'`

## Run the scripts

`python3 'file-name'`
## The Scripts
